# Week 18 NoSQL: Social Network API

## Your Task

Your task is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. You’ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) packages, you may also optionally use a JavaScript date library of your choice (Moment.js) or the native JavaScript `Date` object to format timestamps.

No seed data is provided, so you’ll need to create your own data using Insomnia after you’ve created your API.

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.

## Languages Used

- NodeJS
- Express
- MongoDB
- Mongoose ODM

## Project Notes

All routes are working for users/friends and thoughts/reactions. Walkthrough video showing functionality had to be done in two videos as I wasn't fast enough to cover all the routes in less than 5 mins. Used Moment.js for the createdAt timestamps.
